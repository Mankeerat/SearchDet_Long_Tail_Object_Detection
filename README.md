# ðŸ”¥ SearchDet: Training-Free Long Tail Object Detection via Web-Image Retrieval ðŸ”¥
This repository contains the official code for SearchDet, a training-free framework for long-tail, open-vocabulary object detection. SearchDet leverages web-retrieved positive and negative support images to dynamically generate query embeddings for precise object localizationâ€”all without additional training.

---

SearchDet is designed to:

- âœ… Enhance Open-Vocabulary Detection: Improve detection performance on long-tail classes by retrieving and leveraging web images.
- âœ… Operate Training-Free: Eliminate the need for costly fine-tuning and continual pre-training by computing query embeddings at inference time.
- âœ… Utilize State-of-the-Art Models: Integrate off-the-shelf models like DINOv2 for robust image embeddings and SAM for generating region proposals.

Our method demonstrates substantial mAP improvements over existing approaches on challenging datasetsâ€”all while keeping the inference pipeline lightweight and training-free.

Key Features
- Web-Based Exemplars: Retrieve positive and negative support images from the web to create dynamic, context-sensitive query embeddings.
- Attention-Based Query Generation: Enhance detection by weighting support images based on cosine similarity with the input query.
- Robust Region Proposals: Use SAM to generate high-quality segmentation proposals that are refined via similarity heatmaps.
- Adaptive Thresholding: Apply frequency-based thresholding to automatically select the most relevant region proposals.
- Scalable Inference: Achieve strong performance with just a few support imagesâ€”ideal for long-tailed object detection scenarios.
